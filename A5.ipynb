    "## Meta Instructions\n",
    "1. Environment: \n",
    "    - Install the required package using: `pip install scikit-learn openai`\n",
    "    - Additional packages may be required depending on your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finish coding tasks according to instructions in this file, and change the code in the required area, which is indicated by \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please summarize all your implementation process, experiment details, results, analysis, discussion and thoughts into a 2-page report. It is encouraged that you include a short proposal for future improvement in the conclusion part. Please submit the report in PDF format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submission: submit a zip file named \"StuID_Name.zip\" (e.g., \"A0123456J_Wang-Wenjie.zip\") to Canvas **Assignments -> Assignment5**. Note that it is **NOT** NUSNET ID. The zip file should **only** include \"StuID_Assignment_5.ipynb\" and \"StuID_Assignment_5.pdf\" with your implemented code. The submissison deadline is **23:59 on Apr. 11**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Please strictly follow the above instructions, otherwise a grade deduction will be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Rules:  \n",
    "1. Successfully completing the missing parts in the notebook, running the full workflow, and submitting a well-structured report that demonstrates your reasoning will earn you 8/10 of the total score.\n",
    "2. **(Optional Puzzle)**:  If you aim for a higher score and want to earn 1-2 bonus points (without exceeding the maximum score of 60), you need to improve the existing pipeline and include an ablation study. One potential improvement is to predefine a set of data science-related APIs and tools (refer to Assignment 5 tutorial slides). Additional supplementary materials:\n",

    "1. Search for similar questions on Slack (https://app.slack.com/client/T088V95D8LC/C088L557RK8).\n",
    "2. Propose a new question on Slack if not already answered.\n",
    "3. For non-public questions, e-mail to Xiangyan Liu (e0950125@u.nus.edu) and Pengfei Zhou (e1374451@u.nus.edu) with the subject starting with \"CS5260 2025 Spring\""
