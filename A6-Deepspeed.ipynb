    "# Assignment 6: Training Language Models Using DeepSpeed\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore DeepSpeed, a powerful deep learning optimization library developed by Microsoft. DeepSpeed enables training of extreme-scale models through various optimization techniques including ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer), mixed precision training, model parallelism, and memory offloading. You will configure DeepSpeed for different scenarios and analyze the performance impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Understand DeepSpeed's optimization techniques\n",
    "- Configure DeepSpeed for various performance optimization scenarios\n",
    "- Measure and analyze performance metrics across different configurations\n",
    "- Apply the knowledge to train larger models efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "1. Install the required package:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install deepspeed>=0.6.5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Other typically required packages include PyTorch, transformers, accelerate, etc.\n",
    "3. Additional packages may be required depending on your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria\n",
    "- Correct understanding and explanation of DeepSpeed concepts (40%)\n",
    "- Proper implementation and configuration of DeepSpeed (30%)\n",
    "- Thorough analysis of experimental results with metrics (20%)\n",
    "- Report quality and clarity (10%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Successfully answering all questions with thorough explanations and corresponding experimental records, and submitting a well-structured report that demonstrates your reasoning will earn you 8/10 of the total score. There is no optional puzzle this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Materials:  \n",
    "1. [official docs](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  \n",
    "2. [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/usage_guides/deepspeed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For any questions, please do one of the following actions in order of priority:  \n",
    "1. Search for similar questions on Slack (https://app.slack.com/client/T088V95D8LC/C088L557RK8).  \n",
    "2. Post a new question on Slack if it has not already been answered.  \n",
    "3. For non-public questions, email Xiangyan Liu (e0950125@u.nus.edu) and Pengfei Zhou (e1374451@u.nus.edu) with the subject starting with \"CS5260 2025 Spring\"."

    "## Tasks and Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following questions, you need to:\n",
    "1. Explain the concept in detail\n",
    "2. Demonstrate the configuration in a DeepSpeed config file\n",
    "3. Run experiments and record relevant metrics (training speed, GPU memory usage, CPU utilization, etc.)\n",
    "4. Analyze the results and provide insights\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You do not need to train the models on the full dataset, training for a short duration and documenting the necessary metrics is sufficient. Also, evaluation is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: ZeRO Optimization Stages\n",
    "What are the different ZeRO optimization stages in DeepSpeed? What are the characteristics of each stage?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Experiment with different ZeRO stages and measure their impact on memory usage and training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Mixed Precision Training\n",
    "How to configure mixed precision training in DeepSpeed? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Compare the performance of FP32, FP16, and BF16 (if available) training in terms of memory usage, training speed, and convergence (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Model Parallelism\n",
    "How to configure DeepSpeed to implement model parallelism rather than just data parallelism?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Demonstrate the configuration and analyze how it affects training large models across multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Offload Techniques\n",
    "What are DeepSpeed's offload techniques? How to enable them in the configuration?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Experiment with offloading to CPU and/or NVMe and analyze the trade-offs between memory usage and training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Training Larger Models\n",
    "Using the knowledge gained from the previous questions, configure DeepSpeed to train a larger model (from the [pythia collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/EleutherAI/pythia-scaling-suite-64fb5dfa8c21ebb3db7ad2e1)) than would be possible with standard training approaches. Try to maximize model size while maintaining reasonable training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Demonstrate your approach, configuration, and analyze the results in terms of model size, memory usage, and training speed.\n"
